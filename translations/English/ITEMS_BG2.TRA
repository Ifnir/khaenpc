In the halls of ancient ruins, where memories are but dreams,
With the key that opens doors, to the world beyond our sight,
The path to Mepsfo's Undead realm, shall be revealed tonight.

Twist the dial three times to the left, then four to the right,
Whisper the incantation, "Aperi Mors manu fortis".
Step forward without hesitation, and cross the threshold with might.
The realm of Mepsfo's Undead, shall come into your sight.

But be warned, time moves differently within these hallowed walls.
What is but a moment here, could be eons in the world beyond.
So heed this counsel well, and do not linger in its halls,
For to leave Mepsfo's Undead realm, you must recite this song.

Raise your hand and close your eyes, and speak these words with care,
"Redi ad lucem, porta clausa est."
And with a final glimpse, at the realm you once did share,
You shall return to your own world, free from its dark ensnare.~
