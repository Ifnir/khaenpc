@0 = ~Sooo. I like to avoid the Bridge District for now.~
@1 = ~Why is that?.~
@2 = ~Well this guy I owe, he resides there. I don't presume, you know him, he's name is Bror.~
@3 = ~Are you serious! It's a big deal. He's a prominent guildleader for Shadow Thieves, he's very dangerous.~
@4 = ~I believe he can be merciful, if we go directly to him now, we can avoid his wrath.~
@5 = ~I agree with Yoshimo, maybe there's another way you can pay back your debt.~
@6 = ~Ehhhh, okay. Alright, I guess, it's better to owe you, <CHARNAME>, than him. Did I by the way tell it's 5000 coins?~
@7 = ~You did not.. I already starting to regret this, but anyway let move on.~

@23 = ~What about we visit him, and maybe we can make a deal with him?~
